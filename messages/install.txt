Thanks for installing Sequoia!


How to activate
===============

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (âŒ˜+, on Mac):

{
    "theme": "Sequoia.sublime-theme",
    "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Sequoia/Sequoia.tmTheme"
}

*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.*
